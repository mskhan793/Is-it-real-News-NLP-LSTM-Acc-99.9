# Is-it-real-News-NLP-LSTM-Acc-99.9
"Fake News Detection with Machine Learning", In this project we are going to train a ML model to detect fake news based on Recurrent Neural Network. We will explot "Natural Language Processing (NLP)" to convert text into numbers. Theses numbers are then fed to train ML model (LSTM) for predicting the authenticity of news. The tasks performed in this project are:

Exploratory data analysis
Data cleaning
Visualize datasets
Prepare the data by performing tokenization and padding
Train an LSTM Model
Evaluate trained model performance

The dataset can be accessed using given link from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

Note: It's not the final version. With the passage of time, i'll update it.
